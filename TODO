Uninstall rofi? 

Use a timer to show xworkspaces for like 5 seconds

When switching between desktops with bspwm, there is quick way to prevent wrapping
around at the ends (e.g. 1 and 5).

Swapping desktops (this is builtin and should be easy, just way too late right now
for me to worry about it)

I leave figuring out HDMI to later. Will definitely have to
enable GPU first, and maybe restart xorg since nvidia module needs to be
loaded before xorg starts. I don't know you'll figure it out.

I also should really be using relative paths in here (e.g. in case I want to move
~/dotfiles to ~/.dotfiles)
